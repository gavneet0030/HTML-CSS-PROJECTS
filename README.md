<h2 align="center"> Purpose</h2>

<p align="center">
  This repository is created to strengthen <b>frontend development fundamentals</b>
  by building clean, responsive, and well-structured user interfaces
  using <b>HTML and CSS only</b>.
</p>

<p align="center">
  The main goal is to practice modern layout techniques, understand
  responsive design principles, and write maintainable frontend code
  without relying on JavaScript or external frameworks.
</p>

<p align="center">
  This project serves as a:
</p>

<p align="center">
  • Learning platform for frontend fundamentals<br/>
  • Practical showcase of UI layout skills<br/>
  • Foundation for advanced frontend and full-stack development
</p>

<hr/>



<h2 align="center"> Project Overview</h2>

<p align="center">
  This repository contains a curated set of frontend projects developed
  using <b>HTML5</b> and <b>CSS3</b>, focusing on real-world UI layouts
  and responsive web design patterns.
</p>

<p align="center">
  Each project demonstrates a structured approach to building user
  interfaces, emphasizing clean markup, reusable styles, and consistent
  visual hierarchy across different screen sizes.
</p>

<p align="center">
  The projects are designed to reflect:
</p>

<p align="center">
  • Semantic and accessible HTML structure<br/>
  • Modern CSS layout techniques (Flexbox & Grid)<br/>
  • Responsive behavior for desktop and mobile views<br/>
  • Clean, minimal, and user-friendly UI components
</p>

<p align="center">
  This collection evolves progressively, with every project improving
  upon design decisions, layout efficiency, and frontend best practices.
</p>

<hr/>





<h2 align="center"> Technology Stack</h2>


<p align="center">
  This project collection is created and designed using only core
  frontend technologies, with a strong focus on clean structure and
  responsive layouts.

<h2 align="center"> Big-O-Table </h2>

<p align="center">
  Since this repository contains projects built using only
  <b>HTML and CSS</b>, there are no algorithms or data structures involved.
  However, performance considerations are related to how browsers process
  HTML and CSS.
</p>

<p align="center">
  Below is a conceptual performance table for static frontend projects:
</p>

<p align="center">
<table align="center">
  <tr>
    <th>Process</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Time Complexity</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>HTML Parsing</td>
    <td>Browser reads and builds the DOM</td>
    <td>O(n)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CSS Parsing</td>
    <td>Stylesheets are parsed and rules applied</td>
    <td>O(n)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Rendering</td>
    <td>Layout, paint, and display</td>
    <td>Depends on layout size</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</p>

<p align="center">
  This table helps understand how static web pages are processed by the browser
  and why clean, optimized HTML & CSS improve performance.
</p>



<h2 align="center"> HTML & CSS Render Pipeline (Flowchart)</h2>

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/gavneet0030/HTML-CSS-PROJECTS/blob/main/chart/HTML%20CSSOM%20Render%20Pipeline-2026-01-15-132205.png"
       alt="HTML CSS Render Pipeline Flowchart"
       width="80%" />
</p>

<p align="center">
  The above flowchart represents the complete rendering process followed
  by the browser to display HTML and CSS based projects.
</p>

<p align="center">
  This render pipeline is applicable to projects such as
  <b>Pookie Card</b> and <b>Square Hover</b> included in this repository.
</p>

<p align="center">
  • HTML file is loaded and parsed to create the DOM tree<br/>
  • CSS file is loaded and parsed to create the CSSOM tree<br/>
  • DOM and CSSOM are combined to form the Render Tree<br/>
  • Layout calculation determines size and position of elements<br/>
  • Painting phase draws the UI on the screen<br/>
  • Final rendered output is displayed to the user
</p>

<p align="center">
  This flowchart helps in understanding how structure and styling work
  together to produce the final user interface.
